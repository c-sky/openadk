System requirements
-------------------

OpenADK is designed to run on Linux systems. But there is support to run on
MacOS X, Windows with Cygwin, OpenBSD, MirBSD, NetBSD and FreeBSD. Main
development happens on Debian/GNU Linux and MacOS X. The other host platforms
are occasionally tested.  OpenADK detects the host system and displays only the
software packages, which are known to be cross-compilable on the used host.
For example OpenJDK7 is only cross-compilable on a Linux host.

OpenADK needs some software to be already installed on the host
system; here is the list of the mandatory packages,
package names may vary between host systems.

* Build tools:

** +binutils+
** +C compiler (gcc or clang)+ 
** `C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)`
** +make+
** +gzip+
** +perl+
** +tar+
** +git+
** +strings+
** +curl or wget+
** +ncurses development files+
** +zlib development files+
** +libc development files+

There is a check for the required versions of these tools in advance,
though.

For some packages there are some optional packages required. OpenADK
will check for the required tools in advance, when a specific package is
choosen. For example Kodi needs Java installed on the host system.
OpenADK tries to avoid any optional required host tools and will try to
build them when needed.
